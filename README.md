This encoder is a safeguard against AI cracking methods (mathematical approximation). Might not be useful now, but some time in the future.
Without loss of generality, 
Assume a perfect approximation exists, and a possible set of secret_keys of length N
A perfect encoding method is unskewed, such that each char in the token string decreases the set_length by a factor of 256
This encoding method is to answer that question
